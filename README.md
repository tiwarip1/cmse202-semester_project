# Visualizing Thermodynamic Processes Using Python

This repository contains the work done for CMSE 202-001 Final Project: Visualizing
Thermodynamic Processes Using Python. The project simulates certain thermodynamic
processes of ideal gasses utilizing Python classes, iVisual, and other Python packages.

### Contributors
Nathan Everett, D'Ontai Lewis, Erika Lustig, Pranjal Tiwari

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you to run a majority of the Jupyter notebook that
contains the visualizations, using a Python file that contains the class definitions.

### Prerequisites
The paths used in the code are optimized for Macs and will need to be changed to work
on Windows computers.
* Jupyter
* iVisual
```
pip install IVisual
```
* numpy
* PIL
```
pip install Pillow
```
* Matplotlib

### Installing
Download the Final_Project_Classes.py and Final_Project_Visualization.ipynb files,
or clone the repository. Those are the only two files needed to run the project.

## Running
Launch a Jupyter notebook server and launch Final_Project_Visualization.ipynb.
Starting from the first cell, run each until the section labeled 'Image Processing
to Create Visualizations'. You will be able to see the visualizations in the notebook,
including the iVisual animations and matplotlib graphs.
The last section of the notebook was used to generate the presentation MP4 files and
will not work without generating images in the other parts of the notebook (those
lines were commented out and significantly decrease performance of the notebook
animations).

## Contributions
All group members equally contributed. All work, except for presentation slides, were done in group meetings with screen-sharing. Presentation slides were completed in Google Slides with equal contribution.
